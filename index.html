    <p> My favorite hobby is origami because it's very fun to see the final product after you've sent some of your time on it. Even if it takes a couple minutes, or it takes a month, it's quite nice. Also, you don't need to bring special pieces of paper sometimes; you can just use a Post-It or a piece of paper after cutting it into a square. Overall, it's very easy to learn as well. </p>
